pfifc: Permutation Feature Importance using Functional Connectivity data

This directory will have an implementation of a permutation feature importance analysis (e.g. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/permutation_importance.html), with functions designed specifically for working with functional connectivity data (neuroimaging). The main purpose is to be able to permute sets/a-priori defined groups of features at a single time, which the sklearn implementation does not allow.
